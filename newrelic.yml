  # The newrelic agent communicates with the service via https by default.  This
  # prevents eavesdropping on the performance metrics transmitted by the agent.
  # The encryption required by SSL introduces a nominal amount of CPU overhead,
  # which is performed asynchronously in a background thread.  If you'd prefer
  # to send your metrics over http uncomment the following line.
